It then imports the essential NLTK libraries and pandas, downloads the required NLTK data files such as 'punkt', 'stopwords', 'wordnet', and 'omw-1.4', and initializes the stop words and lemmatizer. The preprocess_text function is defined to tokenize the text, remove punctuation and stop words, and apply lemmatization, preparing the text data for further processing. Finally, the dataset is loaded into the DataFrame df for subsequent analysis."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"id":"3fb7616d","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-21T18:25:38.937119Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-21T18:25:38.936664Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-21T18:25:39.435781Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-21T18:25:39.434508Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.508267,"end_time":"2024-12-21T18:25:39.437859","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-12-21T18:25:38.929592","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Archive:  /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet.zip\r\n","   creating: /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/\r\n","  inflating: /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/lexnames  \r\n","  inflating: /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/data.verb  \r\n","  inflating: /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/index.adv  \r\n","  inflating: /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/adv.exc  \r\n","  inflating: /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/index.verb  \r\n","  inflating: /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/cntlist.rev  \r\n","  inflating: /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/data.adj  \r\n","  inflating: /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/index.adj  \r\n","  inflating: /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/LICENSE  \r\n","  inflating: /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/citation.bib  \r\n","  inflating: /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/noun.exc  \r\n","  inflating: /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/verb.exc  \r\n","  inflating: /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/README  \r\n","  inflating: /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/index.sense  \r\n","  inflating: /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/data.noun  \r\n","  inflating: /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/data.adv  \r\n","  inflating: /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/index.noun  \r\n","  inflating: /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/adj.exc  \r\n"]}],"source":["#to troubleshoot issues with NLTK download, especially related to corpora-wordnet\n","\n","!unzip /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/wordnet.zip -d /usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"id":"f085d63b","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-21T18:25:39.452256Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-21T18:25:39.451861Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-21T18:25:50.959693Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-21T18:25:50.958566Z"},"papermill":{"duration":11.516985,"end_time":"2024-12-21T18:25:50.961411","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-12-21T18:25:39.444426","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /usr/share/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package punkt is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /usr/share/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package wordnet to /usr/share/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package wordnet is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package omw-1.4 to /usr/share/nltk_data...\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>text_column</th>\n","      <th>preprocessed_text</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>title</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Mental health nurse</th>\n","      <td>Arm drive court sure vote.

The evaluation metrics are as follows:\n","\n","* **Precision**: 0.33\n","* **Recall**: 0.34 for class 0 and 0.32 for class 1\n","* **F1-Score**: 0.34 for class 0 and 0.33 for class 1\n","* **Accuracy**: 0.33\n","\n","These results indicate that our model still struggles to accurately differentiate between fraudulent and non-fraudulent job postings. This underscores the importance of using real-world data to build a meaningful and robust model. No matter how sophisticated our synthetic data generation methods are, they cannot fully replace the variability and complexity found in actual data.\n","\n","## **Conclusion and Takeaways**\n","In this notebook, we embarked on the journey of detecting fraudulent job postings using NLP techniques. We began by understanding our dataset, which initially only contained fraudulent job postings. To create a balanced dataset, we generated synthetic non-fraudulent samples using two methods: a random function and synonym replacement. We then preprocessed the text data, converted it into numerical features, and trained a Logistic Regression model.\n","\n","Our model's performance, as reflected in the evaluation metrics, highlighted the limitations of synthetic data. The results emphasized the need for real-world non-fraudulent data to achieve meaningful and reliable model predictions. Future work should focus on sourcing more realistic non-fraudulent job postings and exploring advanced models and hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.\n","\n","### **Key takeaways from this project include:**\n","\n","* The importance of balanced datasets: A model can only learn effectively when it has a well-rounded view of both classes.\n","* Limitations of synthetic data: While synthetic data can help in initial stages, real-world data is crucial for building robust models.\n","* Continuous improvement: Model building is an iterative process, requiring constant refinement and validation to achieve the best results.\n","\n","Thank you for following along this journey.
